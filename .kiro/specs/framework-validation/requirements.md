# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures the autonomous agent-based testing framework functions correctly across different scenarios, providing both CLI and API interfaces that can handle codebases with no existing tests or with existing test suites. The framework should autonomously create comprehensive test suites that improve code quality through intelligent analysis and generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI interface to work reliably with any Python codebase, so that I can easily audit and improve test quality from the command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `python -m src audit ./project-path` on a codebase with no tests THEN the system SHALL successfully map the codebase structure and generate appropriate test files
2. WHEN I run `python -m src audit ./project-path` on a codebase with existing tests THEN the system SHALL analyze existing tests and generate additional tests for uncovered code
3. WHEN I use CLI flags like `--no-generate` or `--no-mutation` THEN the system SHALL respect these options and skip the specified operations
4. WHEN I run `python -m src analyze ./project-path` THEN the system SHALL provide analysis without making any changes to the codebase
5. WHEN CLI operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and graceful failure handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Python API to work programmatically with different codebase scenarios, so that I can integrate the framework into automated workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initialize `TestingFramework(project_path=path)` with a project containing no tests THEN the system SHALL create the necessary directory structure and proceed with analysis
2. WHEN I call `framework.run_full_audit()` on any valid Python project THEN the system SHALL complete all stages without crashing
3. WHEN I use the API with different LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic) THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and use the configured provider
4. WHEN I call individual agent methods like `code_mapper.map_codebase()` THEN the system SHALL return structured data that other agents can consume
5. WHEN API operations fail THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate exceptions with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to handle codebases with no existing tests gracefully, so that I can bootstrap test suites for legacy projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework encounters a project with no `tests/` directory THEN the system SHALL create the directory structure automatically
2. WHEN analyzing a codebase with zero test files THEN the system SHALL report 0% coverage and proceed with test generation
3. WHEN generating tests for uncovered code units THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive test files with proper imports and structure
4. WHEN no existing tests are found THEN the system SHALL still provide meaningful quality metrics and recommendations
5. WHEN test generation completes for a previously untested codebase THEN the system SHALL produce a complete audit report showing the improvement from 0% coverage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to enhance existing test suites intelligently, so that I can improve the quality of codebases that already have some test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework analyzes existing tests THEN the system SHALL correctly identify test types, assertions, and mocks
2. WHEN existing tests have low quality scores THEN the system SHALL generate improved versions or additional test cases
3. WHEN existing tests cover some code units THEN the system SHALL focus generation efforts on uncovered or poorly tested units
4. WHEN mutation testing is enabled THEN the system SHALL run tests against the existing codebase and report mutation scores
5. WHEN the audit completes THEN the system SHALL provide before/after comparisons showing specific improvements made

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and validation, so that the framework provides reliable feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid project paths are provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and exit gracefully
2. WHEN LLM provider credentials are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL detect this and provide setup instructions
3. WHEN file parsing errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the specific file and continue processing other files
4. WHEN test generation fails for specific code units THEN the system SHALL continue with other units and report which ones failed
5. WHEN network or API errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and provide meaningful error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to produce high-quality test code, so that the generated tests actually improve my codebase quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are generated THEN the system SHALL produce syntactically correct Python code that follows pytest conventions
2. WHEN test quality is judged THEN the system SHALL only save tests that meet minimum quality thresholds (score >= 7.0)
3. WHEN tests are created for functions with dependencies THEN the system SHALL include appropriate mocking
4. WHEN tests are generated for classes THEN the system SHALL include setup/teardown and test multiple methods
5. WHEN edge cases exist in the code THEN the system SHALL generate tests that cover error conditions and boundary cases

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed reporting and metrics, so that I can understand the improvements made and plan next steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audit completes THEN the system SHALL generate both markdown and JSON reports with comprehensive metrics
2. WHEN before/after comparisons are made THEN the system SHALL show specific deltas for coverage, assertions, and quality scores
3. WHEN recommendations are provided THEN the system SHALL give actionable advice for further improvements
4. WHEN multiple iterations run THEN the system SHALL track progress across iterations and stop when no further improvements are possible
5. WHEN reports are saved THEN the system SHALL use timestamped filenames and organize them in a reports directory
