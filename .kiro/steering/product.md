# Product Overview

## Autonomous Agent-Based Testing Framework

This is a comprehensive Python framework that uses AI agents to autonomously analyze, assess, and improve test quality through dependency mapping, mutation testing, and intelligent test generation.

### Core Purpose
- **Autonomous Testing Improvement**: Uses AI agents to automatically identify testing gaps and generate high-quality test cases
- **Quality Assessment**: Provides comprehensive metrics including coverage, mutation scores, assertion density, and test clarity
- **Mutation Testing**: Validates test effectiveness through fault injection and mutation analysis
- **Dependency Mapping**: Creates comprehensive code structure maps using AST parsing

### Key Features
- Multi-agent architecture with specialized roles (CodeMapper, TestDiscovery, TestAssessor, TestGenerator, TestJudge, AuditReporter)
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere)
- Comprehensive reporting with before/after comparisons
- CLI interface for easy integration into workflows
- Iterative improvement process with quality thresholds

### Target Users
- Development teams looking to improve test coverage and quality
- QA engineers seeking automated test generation
- DevOps teams implementing quality gates
- Individual developers wanting comprehensive test analysis
